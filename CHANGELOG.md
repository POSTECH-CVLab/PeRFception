## Unreleased version

- Added `navbar-var-length` config setting that allows the navigation menu to be the same length as the longest sub-menu, so that long words in the submenu are not cut off (#765) 
- Added `post_search` config setting that creates a Search button in the navbar (older websites need to set `post_search: true` to enable this feature) (#770)
- Added `edit_page_button` config setting that adds a "Edit page" button to the footer (to edit the current page on GitHub) (#1004)
- BREAKING CHANGE: More control over RSS feed sharing: previously, an RSS feed was *always* generated, and if the config setting `rss-description` was set then there was an RSS icon in the footer. Now, an RSS feed is only generated when the config setting `rss-description` exists, and an RSS footer icon is only shown if `rss: true` is set in the `social-network-links` config settings 
- Fixed page titles, subtitles, and excerpts rendering correctly when there are special characeters in them (#856) 
- Slightly reworked margins and position for avatar image to resolve an alignment issue on Safari.
- Changed the width at which the navbar collapses to a higher threshold because most modern non-mobile browsers are >1000px
- Fixed bug where navbar secondary level dropdown items didn't inherit the same colour as the primary navbar links
- Fixed bug where the navbar "burger" collapsed button didn't always revert back to a light colour
- Fixed bug where using an image as a navbar title did not render in GitHub Project pages that did not have a custom domain
- Fixed issue where image thumbnails on the feed page were always forced into a square rather than maintaining a proper image aspect ratio
- Added support for Patreon, Medium, and Itch.io in the social network links in the footer (#783, #788)
- Fixed bug where special characters in the title led to broken share tags (#744)
- Updated staticman from using v2 (public servers) to v3 (private servers) due to the public servers becoming obsolete (#775)
- Added support for Cloudflare Analytics (#797)
- Added Reddit in share options of posts (#815)
- Added support for giscus comments (#886) and CommentBox (#960)
- Fixed bug where staticman didn't work jQuery slim version is used (#766)
- Fixed very long strings to wrap around the next line rather than go off-screen (#787)
- Added `footer-hover-col` config setting to customize the hover colour of links in the footer (#848)
- Added social network links for Discord (#907), Kaggle (#961), and Hackerrank (#978)
- Made the home page feed more accessible for screen readers (#950) 

## v5.0.0 (2020-09-15)

One of the major changes in this version is that a lot of time was spent on rethinking the entire SEO and social media sharing model (how a page looks on eg. Google, Twitter, Facebok). It was redesigned to be more simple and customizable. The new documentation has a section dedicated to SEO and social media sharing of a page. Unfortunately some changes that are not backwards-compatible had to be made.

#### Breaking changes

- Renamed `description` YAML parameter to `share-description` to be more clear
- Renamed `description` config setting to `rss-description` since it was only used in RSS (the FAQ explains the difference between YAML parameters and config settings if you're confused)
- Removed YAML parameter `use-site-title` (you can now specify the exact title using `share-title`)
- Removed undocumented YAML parameters `meta-title` and `meta-description`
- Removed `link-tags` config setting because it wasn't necessary. If you use tags, there will now always be a tags page created; if you don't use tags there won't be a tags page.
- The YAML parameter `show-avatar` is now true by default. This has always been the case for GitHub Pages users, but not for `remote_theme` users. For consistency, it's now the default for everyone. (#715)

#### New parameters and settings

- Added `full-width` YAML parameter to allow having full-width pages
- Added `feed_show_excerpt` config setting to show/hide the post excerpts on the feed page
- Added `feed_show_tags` config setting to show/hide the list of tags on post previews on the feed page
- Added `share-title` YAML parameter to give control over the search engine/social media title
- Added `last-updated` YAML parameter to show a "Last Updated on" date for blog posts
- Added `before-content` and `after-content` YAML parameters that allow you to add some common HTML before the main content of a page (below the title) or after the main content (above the footer). Works in a similar way to `footer-extra`.
- Added `head-extra` YAML parameter which is similar to `footer-extra` but is used to include custom HTML code in a page's `<head>` tag
- Added `site-js` config setting to provide JavaScript files that are used on all pages in the site

#### New features and improvements

- Improved the `footer-extra` YAML parameter to support multiple files instead of only a single file
- Added automatic navbar color detection (#702)
- When `nav-short` is turned on, the avatar will also be shorter
- Changed navbar and footer background colour to be slightly darker, for better contrast with the default white page background for accessibility reasons
- Changed the behaviour of `site-css` to include site-wide CSS file **before** instead of after page-specific files
- Renamed internal css/js files from "main" to "beautifuljekyll" to make it easier for users to troubleshoot
- Added alt text to all images for better accessibility
- Made thumbnail images square instead of circles, as users reported that circles cut off important parts of images

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed rendering issues with `nav-short` parameter that caused the body of the page to start too low
- Fixed some CSS styles that broke during the bootstrap 4 migration (#716)

#### Library upgrades

- Upgraded kramdown to version 2.3.0 to fix security issues
- Upgraded jQuery to version 3.5.1 to fix a couple security vulnerabilities with the previous version

## v3.0.0 (2020-05-07)
