## Acknowledgement

We appreciate reviewers for their constructive comments and valuable suggestions. We have updated our paper to reflect them. In addition, we were able to complete this work since two nice datasets, CO3D and ScanNet were publicly avaialable. Lastly, thanks for offering a great free logo generation tool in the link [here](https://www.squarespace.com/logo). We have made the logo using publicly available icon and fonts.
