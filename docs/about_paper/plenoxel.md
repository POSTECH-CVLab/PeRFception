# Plenoxels: Radiance Fields without Neural Networks (CVPR22 Oral)

[Project Page](https://alexyu.net/plenoxels){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-2.5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 } [Code](){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-2.5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }

We employ Plenoxels as our main data structure since it uses universal features, spherical harnomics coefficients, and allows fast training (~20 minutes per scene). We elaborate details of Plenoxels for users who are not familiar with the concepts of Plenoxels. For thorough details about Plenoxels, we recommend to refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05131).
