# Plenoxels: Radiance Fields without Neural Networks

We employ Plenoxels as our main data structure since it uses universal features, spherical harnomics coefficients, and allows fast training (~20 minutes per scene). We elaborate details of Plenoxels for users who are not familiar with the concepts of Plenoxels. For thorough details about Plenoxels, we recommend to refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05131). 




## Why Plenoxels?

There were several projects which notably reduced training time of neural fields approaches. We have compared
